```

## üìù Code Standards

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Async/Await**: Use async/await patterns consistently throughout the codebase

### Async Node-Based Architecture Guidelines

GTPlanner uses PocketFlow's async node-based architecture. When contributing:

1. **Node Implementation**
   ```python
   from pocketflow import AsyncNode

   class AsyncCustomNode(AsyncNode):
       async def run(self, shared_memory: dict) -> dict:
           """
           Process data asynchronously.

           Args:
               shared_memory: Shared state between nodes

           Returns:
               Updated shared memory
           """
           # Your implementation here
           return shared_memory
   ```

2. **Flow Definition**
   ```python
   from pocketflow import AsyncFlow

   flow = AsyncFlow()
   flow.add_node("input", AsyncInputNode())
   flow.add_node("process", AsyncProcessNode())
   flow.add_edge("input", "process")
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always handle exceptions gracefully
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users

### File Organization

- **Core Logic**: Place main functionality in the root directory
- **Utilities**: Place helper functions in `utils/` directory
- **API**: Place API-related code in `api/` directory
- **Documentation**: Place design docs in `docs/` directory
- **Tests**: Create test files alongside the code they test

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Since GTPlanner doesn't currently have automated tests, thorough manual testing is essential:

#### CLI Testing
```bash
# Test interactive mode
uv run python main.py

# Test with direct input
echo "Build a REST API for user management" | uv run python main.py

# Test with markdown files
uv run python main.py --input "Enhance existing API" --files existing_docs.md
```

#### API Testing
```bash
# Start the API server
uv run python fastapi_main.py

# Test short planning endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:11211/planning/short" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"requirement": "Create a mobile app for task management"}'

# Test long planning endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:11211/planning/long" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"requirement": "Build an e-commerce platform", "previous_flow": "..."}'
```

#### MCP Service Testing
```bash
# Start MCP service
cd mcp
uv run python mcp_service.py

# Test with MCP client (Cherry Studio, Cursor, etc.)
# Configure MCP client with: http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp
```

### Test Cases to Cover

When testing your changes, ensure you cover:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Empty requirements
   - Very long requirements
   - Special characters and Unicode
   - Invalid markdown files

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Requirement processing
   - Documentation generation
   - Feedback processing
   - File output

3. **Error Scenarios**
   - Network failures
   - Invalid API responses
   - File system errors
   - Configuration issues

4. **Integration Points**
   - CLI to core engine
   - API to core engine
   - MCP to planning functions

### Writing New Tests

When adding new functionality, create corresponding test scenarios:

1. **Create test files** alongside your code
2. **Document test cases** in your PR description
3. **Include edge cases** and error conditions
4. **Test async functionality** thoroughly

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture Understanding

### PocketFlow-Based Architecture

GTPlanner is built on [PocketFlow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), an async workflow engine. Understanding this architecture is crucial for contributors:

#### Core Concepts

1. **Nodes**: Individual processing units that perform specific tasks
2. **Flows**: Sequences of connected nodes that define the processing pipeline
3. **Shared Memory**: State that persists and is shared between nodes
4. **Async Processing**: All operations are asynchronous for better performance

#### Key Components

1. **CLI Flow** (`cli_flow.py`): Main requirement processing pipeline
2. **Short Planner Flow** (`short_planner_flow.py`): Quick planning generation
3. **Filename Flow** (`filename_flow.py`): Automatic file naming
4. **Nodes** (`nodes.py`): Core async node implementations

#### Node Types

- `AsyncInputProcessingNode`: Handles user input and markdown processing
- `AsyncRequirementsAnalysisNode`: Analyzes and categorizes requirements
- `AsyncDesignOptimizationNode`: Suggests improvements and optimizations
- `AsyncDocumentationGenerationNode`: Creates structured documentation
- `AsyncFeedbackProcessingNode`: Manages iterative refinement

### Data Flow
